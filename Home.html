                Students learn Python under the guidance of our experienced and passionate instructors.
                Basic programming concepts such as Variables, Loops, If-Statements, and Functions are covered in the “Beginner's Room,” while more advanced programming concepts such as Lists and Arrays are taught in the “Advanced Room.”
                Engagement is further supported through coding challenges, where students apply this knowledge through competition for prizes, with support offered by our weekly tutorials.

                You are invited to I/OHack Jr., a fun all-day coding event that inspires middle school students and introduces them to the world of technology and innovation!
                <br>
                <br>
                All students in grades 6-9 are welcome, even if you have never written a single line of code! Students from any school may participate in this event. Students may register individually or as a team.
                <br>
                <br>
                Teams of three or four middle school hackers will collaborate on a software product, with the goal of completing a pitch to present with their team before a judging panel. We will start the day with a lesson, and on-site mentors will be available to support students as they complete their projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our mentors are high school students, with experience teaching summer camp coding classes, leading computer coding club sessions, and managing a competitive robotics programming team.
                Food will be provided, and there will be awards for the top projects!

                        Competitors from over 20 schools from BC to Ontario competed in I/O Labs #hackthepandemic hackathon from May 29 - 31. After kicking off the weekend with an introductory programming bootcamp and presentation workshop, participants worked as teams in a sprint-like event that challenged students to produce an original technological solution that would tackle a challenge presented by COVID-19, all over the course of a weekend.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Experienced coders and non-coders alike were welcome to participate, and mentors were on hand throughout the weekend to support participants as students completed their projects. It was an inspiring weekend that saw "gracious professionalism" as competitors also mentored each other into the wee hours of the night on our communication server, finishing with an exciting end as teams rushed to get their projects in by the midnight deadline, with one team having a GitHub emergency at 11:53pm and the final three teams coming in with a 12AM time stamp.

                        Our seven-member judging panel assessed an impressive array of projects ranging from a pandemic simulator to a telemedicine app, with awards and prizes presented June 5 to the following:

                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Second prize awarded to "iSolution" for their behavioural app designed to encourage Covid -friendly awareness and behaviours

                    <p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        These students stepped up with fantastic ideas, and it was a wonderful event for sharing and combining great minds.

                    <strong>What is a hackathon?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A hackathon is a problem solving, entrepreneurial, and coding event, where students collaborate in teams to build and code original projects. To succeed, teams demonstrate how they would solve a challenge with software.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>What do I need?</strong>
                    <br>
                    At our hackathons, all you need is a computer and an internet connection. We'll set you up from there!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>What is the cost?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Due to our mission to provide opportunities to those facing barriers to quality STEM engagement and education, our events are always completely free. This is made possible through generous sponsorship from Youth Central, Alberta Tech Alliance Association, Calgary Foundation, and the Government of Canada.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Who can attend?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I/OHack: Pandemic is open to all students in grades nine through twelve, regardless of programming experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>What if I can't code?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Whether you are an experienced hacker or you have never written a line of code before, you are welcome. Attending hackathons is a fantastic way for beginners to learn how to code. We kick off our hackathons with an introductory bootcamp to get you started. There are also opportunities for those with interdisciplinary interests to enhance their skills as they work on their concept and presentation, which are equally important to their team's success.
                    Which technology is used for the Hackathon?
                    Our hackathons allow teams to choose any language or development platform for their projects. Discord and Zoom are used for communications.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How do I form a team?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Our hackathons allow teams of up to five students to register together. If you don't have a team before the event, don't worry. When you register, you will have the option to register as an individual or as a team member. If you sign up individually, we will place you on a team.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How do I become a mentor?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Contact us at our email below if you are interested in becoming a mentor for our next hackathon.
